# PythonWebScraping
PR301 Assignment

12/8- Added both my inital practice with webscrpaing (lxml) as well as a tidier version using BeautifulSoup, with each catergory sorted into classes. Edited for Pep8 passability.

16/8- Shuffled code into more of a MVC style. Added in a data class that 'prettifies' some of the data, also added a cmd_file that has the help cmd information. This is incomplete, but has the help prompts I want to provide.

16/8- Added save/load file functionality to CMD

17/8- Added some try/except functions, improved data(graph) code and prettied graphs up. Still don't have passing url functionality. Some unittests have been implemented.
